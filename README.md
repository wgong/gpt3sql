## Use GPT3 to generate SQL from text

Develop a streamlit app to explore GPT-3 Codex capability (https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/introduction) in terms of SQL generation
- Experiment with and validate GPT-3 capability;
- Target SQLite database;
- Use sample dataset from  https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/;

## Get started

Get your own API Key at https://beta.openai.com/, save it into a new file at `app/cfg/api_key.yaml` (make sure this file is gitignored):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY: <ENTER-Your-Own-API-Key>
```

Run the following commands a shell terminal:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd app
$ streamlit run app.py
```

## Example

Prompt submitted at [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground?mode=complete&model=davinci-instruct-beta)

```
"""
Table customers, columns = [CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Company, Address, City, State, Country, PostalCode, Phone, Fax, Email, SupportRepId]
Create a SQLite query for all customers in Texas named Jane
"""

```


The Python code:
```
import os
import openai

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# POST /v1/completions

response = openai.Completion.create(
  model="davinci-instruct-beta",
  prompt="\"\"\"\nTable customers, columns = [CustomerId, FirstName, LastName,  State]\nCreate a SQLite query for all customers in Texas named Jane\n\"\"\"\n\n\n",
  temperature=0,
  max_tokens=256,
  top_p=1,
  frequency_penalty=0,
  presence_penalty=0
)

```

Response:
```
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE State='TX' AND FirstName='Jane'
```
